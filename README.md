__GeoAssist__ is a tool that can be used to see what other players are correctly guessing in GeoGuessr Battle Royale. Don't know what country you're in? No worries, if someone else guesses the correct answer, GeoAssist will notify you immediately so that you make it to the end!

# Getting Started

### Usage

GeoAssist is extremley user-friendly. To get started, simply join a game of battle royale. Once you join a lobby, look in the url bar of your browser. You will see a unique identifier known as a [uuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#:~:text=A%20universally%20unique%20identifier%20(UUID,%2C%20for%20practical%20purposes%2C%20unique). Copy + paste this into GeoAssist.

Sit back and relax! GeoAssist will start watching the game and as soon as someone guesses the correct answer, you will be notified!

#### Note: GeoAssist is not able to see the guess before the lock-in. Therefore GeoAssist is not meant to work alone. You are meant to use it as a tool to help you.
